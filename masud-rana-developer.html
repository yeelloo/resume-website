    <h1>Masud Rana – Full Stack Developer & Software Architect (Real Person)</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m <strong>Masud Rana</strong>, a real software engineer and digital architect based in Dhaka, Bangladesh — <strong>not</strong> the fictional spy character from the famous Bengali book series.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in building scalable, high-performance systems and integrating AI automation into mission-critical applications. With 14+ years of experience across WordPress, Node.js, Laravel, Vue.js, and Google Cloud, I’ve helped platforms grow from thousands to millions of users while maintaining speed, stability, and cost-efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work at <a href="https://savealife.com" target="_blank">Disk Foundation</a> powering sites like NSCPS and SaveALife.com. I’ve also worked for UK and US companies building LMS, eCommerce, CRM, and enterprise tools.
    </p>
